COVID-19 THROUGH THE LENS OF TIME AND SPACE: ASSESSING REGIONAL DISPARITIES AND BEHAVIOURAL RISK.
This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's dynamics and impacts, focusing on regional disparities in incidence and mortality rates. We explore several key dimensions: the variation in COVID-19 cases and deaths across different world regions, the evolution of the virus spread over time, the geographical distribution of mortality rates within Europe, and the potential association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality risk. By examining these aspects, our objective is to glean insights into the multifaceted nature of the pandemic's impact, assess the effectiveness of public health responses, and understand the interplay between health behaviours and COVID-19 outcomes. This study could be pivotal in contributing to the broader understanding of pandemic patterns, aiding policymakers and health professionals in strategizing more effective responses for current and future public health emergencies. The datasets employed in this were sourced from our World in Dataâ€™s complete coronavirus data, and the world development indicators as a supplementary source.
